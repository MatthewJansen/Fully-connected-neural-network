# Fully-connected-neural-network

Python implementation for a fully connected, vectorized neural network which I wrote for the purpose of displaying and challenging my understanding of neural networks. Feel free to play around with the code...ðŸ˜‰

<h3>Note:</h3>

  - Recommended python version: Python 3.8.10 64-bit 
  - Make sure to unzip mnist_data and to add the raw data to the same directory as the code before playing with the code. ðŸ™‚

Neural networks computational graph structure which consists of layers of nodes called â€™neuronsâ€™ which have biases and connecting weighted edges called â€™synapsesâ€™.

The process of training a neural network consists of three steps:

  1. Forward Propagation:
  Here the inputs are fed to the network in order to obtain an output similar to the expected output from the dataset.
  2. Backpropagation:
  This step covers the process through which the relevance of each neuronâ€™s activation values is computed with respect to the cost of the neural networkâ€™s output.
  3. Update Network:
  Finally, based on the results from backpropagating the output, the new weights and biases of the neural network are computed and updated.
  
(See documented discussion for a detailed description of the above list steps in this repo named 'NeuralNetwork.pdf')
Note:
I will update this readme & return to this project at a later stage (more experience required from my end).
